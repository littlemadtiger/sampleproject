##Welcome GFL leaders/members, to my sample introductory github repo for a sample Python project I wrote.

#This is important to understand I am showing a general consistency of knowledge and understanding, and diving into at least understanding how to code in the language itself. 

#For this program, I will be using the following: A decorator, for loops, lists, a dict, conditionals & as well functions. 

#Thank you in advance for checking out my program. I left the details of the code itself in the .py file inside the master branch (main).
